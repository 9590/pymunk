v5.x
----
- use twine to upload to Pypi? https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine
- use travis ci to build osx chipmunk lib file and run tests? https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/osx-ci-environment/
- benchmark against pymunk 4 (done!), cymunk on pypy and cpython
- cache pip downloads on appveyor?
- Think about experimental repr of Body
- Get inspiration of examples and debug drawing from here: https://github.com/liabru/matter-js  
- add better example benchmark for threaded solver on non-windows
- automatic test build of android apk on travis 
- cleanup implementation of autoexample sphinx extension
- pickle: fix shape id 
- make example of good timestep handling

v6+ (all potentially breaking changes)
---
- Remake BB into namedtuple
- Think about split between pymunk.util and pymunk modules
- do we still need pymunk.inf?
- make shape.sensor return bool instead of int
- Think about overriding behavior of sensor shapes in segment and point_query 
  vs segment_first and point_query_nearest (one hits sensors the other does not)
- Think about return tuple of doubles insetad of Vec2d in autogeometry module.
  Skipping the Vec2d can potentially lead to big saving (2x speedup in one 
  microbench).
